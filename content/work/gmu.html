<p>I assisted <a href="https://myeonglee.com/projects/remapping-southside-community-storytelling-urban-renewal-impact">a colleague</a> with bringing an unoptimized <a href="http://34.139.36.112/map">Leaflet map visualization</a> for the <a href="https://urbanrenewalimpact.org/">Urban Renewal Impact</a> website into a working state by making the application more dynamic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Migrated the front end from jQuery to Vue + Vuex to better manage the application's complexity, improving readability, extensibility, and maintainability.</li>
  <li>Rewrote the existing Slim PHP API endpoints and optimized SQL queries to provide data in a more targeted manner, relieving heavy processing and memory demands from the front end by leveraging the functionality of the Postgres database.</li>
</ul>
