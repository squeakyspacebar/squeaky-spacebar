<p>At the Sunlight Foundation, I was a member of Sunlight Labs during its very hectic final year. Due to large staff turnover, I quickly inherited a range of responsibilities that were handled by an entire team of engineers prior.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintained the <a href="https://openstates.org/">Open States</a> project which involved the website; API; MongoDB database; a Dockerized fleet of individually distinct web scrapers for all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico; and data quality for all the ingested data.</li>
  <li>Managed work on Open States with a great community of open source contributors that helped maintain the Open States project, providing status updates, guidance, and PR reviews.</li>
  <li>Helped address continued support requests for Sunlight's other existing projects.</li>
  <li>Managed AWS infrastructure across Sunglight's projects.</li>
  <li>Worked to improve automation of several pipelines to better leverage limited capacity.</li>
  <li>Maintained software tools and systems for internal operations.</li>
  <li>Provided technical assistance to other teams from advice and expertise, to helping develop project prototypes.</li>
</ul>
