<p>I assisted <a href="https://myeonglee.com/projects/remapping-southside-community-storytelling-urban-renewal-impact">a colleague</a> with redesigning and optimizing the implementation of <a href="http://34.139.36.112/map">a Leaflet map visualization</a> developed for the <a href="https://urbanrenewalimpact.org/">Urban Renewal Impact</a> website.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Migrated the front end JavaScript implementation from jQuery to Vue in order to better contain the application's complexity.</li>
  <li>Cleaned up the existing Slim PHP API and reorganized its endpoints to provide necessary data in a more targeted manner to offload processing and memory demands from the front end.</li>
</ul>
