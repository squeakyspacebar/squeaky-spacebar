<p>I joined the <a href="https://www.opendataenterprise.org/">Center for Open Data Enterprise</a> primarily to help with the <a href="https://www.sdgreporting.org/">UN SDG National Reporting Initiative project</a>, aimed at helping national organizations share information on implementing reporting platforms for the UN Sustainable Development Goals. After the UN SDG National Reporting Initiative website, I also assisted with some additional project work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Helped drive the design process for the SDG National Reporting Initiative website in cooperation with <a href="https://www.threespot.com/">Threespot</a>, including creating multiple evolving prototypes to guide architectural decisions.</li>
  <li>Implemented and deployed the final SDG National Reporting Initiative as a Jamstack website powered by Jekyll, Vue, Netlify, ForestAdmin, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize-backed Express APIs. This solution allowed us to leverage a great amount of performance while minimizing costs across multiple dimensions, given the relatively small financial and technical capacity available to the project.</li>
  <li>Overhauled CODE's <a href="https://www.opendataimpactmap.org/">Open Data Impact Map</a> website, including schema redesign, bugfixing, code refactoring (eliminated ~20k lines of code), and updating project infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Implemented a rebranded redesign of CODE's organization website.</li>
  <li>After project work concluded, I volunteered ongoing time to help maintain the organization website.</li>
</ul>
