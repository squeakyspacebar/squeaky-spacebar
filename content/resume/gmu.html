<p>I assisted <a href="https://myeonglee.com/projects/remapping-southside-community-storytelling-urban-renewal-impact">a colleague</a> with bringing an unoptimized <a href="https://leafletjs.com/"><b>Leaflet</b></a> map visualization for the <a href="https://urbanrenewalimpact.org/">Urban Renewal Impact</a> website into a performantly working state for a project deadline.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Migrated the front end from <a href="https://jquery.com/"><b>jQuery</b></a> to <a href="https://vuejs.org/"><b>Vue.js</b></a> + <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vuex"><b>Vuex</b></a> to better manage the application's complexity, improving readability, extensibility, and maintainability.</li>
  <li>Rewrote existing API endpoints (<a href="https://www.slimframework.com/"><b>Slim PHP framework</b></a>) and <b>optimized SQL queries</b> to fetch data in a more targeted manner while migrating heavy processing and memory demands away from the front end by leveraging the backing <b>PostgreSQL</b> database.</li>
  <li>Eliminated large portions of inefficient and redundant code.</li>
</ul>
