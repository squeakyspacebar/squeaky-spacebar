<p>I assisted <a href="https://myeonglee.com/projects/remapping-southside-community-storytelling-urban-renewal-impact">a colleague</a> by fixing <a href="https://urbanrenewalimpact.net/map">an interactive <b>Leaflet</b> visualization</a> with breaking performance issues for the <a href="https://urbanrenewalimpact.org/">Urban Renewal Impact</a>.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Migrated the front-end from <a href="https://jquery.com/"><b>jQuery</b></a> to <a href="https://vuejs.org/"><b>Vue.js</b></a> w/ <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vuex"><b>Vuex</b></a> to better manage the application's relatively complex state and interactivity.</li>
  <li>Redesigned the back-end <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/"><b>Slim PHP</b></a> API endpoints (and SQL queries) to leverage the PostgreSQL database to fetch and serve data in a much more targeted manner, relieving critical processing pressure from the client side.
  <li>Eliminated large portions of inefficient and redundant code, resulting in a whopping <u>net</u> 190k+ lines removed.</li>
</ul>
