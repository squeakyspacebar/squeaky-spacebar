<p>I am currently using computational neuroscience and mathematics research to develop a biologically-inspired architecture framework in <b>Unity</b> (<b>C#</b>) to construct AI networks end-to-end that are capable of fluent understanding and navigation of spatiotemporal environments.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented a basic framework to define network layers as compute shaders and combine them into a single render pass in Unity's scriptable render pipeline system.</li>
