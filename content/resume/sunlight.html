<p>I joined Sunlight Labs during its hectic final year, inheriting a rapidly evolving situation and a range of responsibilities due to large staff turnover.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Maintained the <a href="https://openstates.org/">Open States</a> <b>open source</b> project. This involved maintaining the <b>Django</b> website and API; <b>MongoDB</b> database; a <b>Docker</b>-based fleet of unique web scrapers (<b>Python</b>) for all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico; and daily data quality across all of the ingested data. The web scrapers required frequent maintenance due to publishing inconsistencies and system changes from official state sources, with commensurate amounts of data quality work.</li>
  <li>Managed <b>open source</b> community contributions to Open States, providing status updates, guidance, and PR reviews.</li>
  <li>Helped address continued support requests and infrastructure maintenance demands for Sunlight's other existing projects and tools, both internal and external.</li>
  <li>Worked to improve automation of several pipelines to better leverage limited capacity.</li>
  <li>Provided technical assistance to other teams, from guidance to infrastructure setup for project prototypes.</li>
</ul>
