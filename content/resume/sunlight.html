<p>I was a member of Sunlight Labs during its hectic final year. I quickly inherited a range of responsibilities due to large staff turnover.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintained the <a href="https://openstates.org/">Open States</a> project. This involved the Django website and API; MongoDB database; a Dockerized fleet of distinct web scrapers for all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico; and ensuring data quality across all of the ingested data by daily review. The scrapers required frequent maintenance due to inconsistent/breaking content publication or system changes from official state sources, and the data quality work was commensurate.</li>
  <li>Managed community contribution to Open States, providing status updates, guidance, and PR reviews.</li>
  <li>Helped address continued support requests and infrastructure maintenance for Sunlight's other existing projects and tools, both internal and external.</li>
  <li>Worked to improve automation of several pipelines to better leverage limited capacity.</li>
  <li>Provided technical assistance to other teams from guidance to helping develop and set up infrastructure for project prototypes.</li>
</ul>
