<p>I joined the <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/">Dallas Morning News</a> as an inaugural member of their new in-house developer team, where I primarily worked on designing and building a graph-based knowledge system — using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/"><b>Amazon Neptune</b></a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch"><b>Elasticsearch</b></a>, and <a href="https://graphql.org/"><b>GraphQL</b></a> — for powering features across the DMN website.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Built the core software (<b>Node.js</b>) for an internal knowledge graph system backed by Amazon Neptune and Elasticsearch.</li>
  <li>Wrote an <b>object-graph mapping (OGM)</b> library that generated <a href="https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html"><b>Gremlin</b></a> queries (graph traversal language used by Amazon Neptune) for Node.js applications.</li>
  <li>Wrote a preprocessor tool (Node.js) that dynamically generated the entire definition for the knowledge graph system's GraphQL API and stood up the API server. The tool utilized GraphQL as a DDL (data definition language), allowing less backend-oriented developers to submit updates to the API's data model by simply modifying GraphQL schema definition files, and reducing the load on me in managing API updates.</li>
  <li>Helped develop and maintain knowledge graph systems such as the administrative interface and AWS infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Managed implementation, <b>ETL</b>, data cleaning, and data processing for a number of content features that utilized the knowledge graph including the <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/sponsored/giving-guide/">North Texas Giving Guide</a>, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/top-100/">Top 100 Places to Work</a>, and <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/school-guide/">School Guide</a>.</li>
  <li>Assisted in migrating <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/">dallasnews.com</a> from a custom CMS onto the Washington Post's Arc Fusion (<a href="https://react.dev/"><b>React</b></a>-based) platform for a site relaunch.</li>
  <li>Assisted in developing React components for the DMN website, often centered around event search functionality that utilized the knowledge graph system.</li>
</ul>
