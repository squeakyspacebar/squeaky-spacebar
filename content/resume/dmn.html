<p>I joined the <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/">Dallas Morning News</a> as an inaugural member of their new in-house developer team, working primarily on a new knowledge graph system for local information and features that utilized it.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>LocalGraf:
    <ul>
      <li>Built the core software for a local information knowledge graph system (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/"><b>Amazon Neptune</b></a>, <b>Elasticsearch</b>) called LocalGraf.</li>
      <li>Built an (<b>Node.js</b>) <b>object-graph mapping (OGM)</b> library that generated <a href="https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html"><b>Gremlin</b></a> queries (graph traversal language used by Amazon Neptune).</li>
      <li>Wrote a (Node.js) preprocessor tool that dynamically regenerated the entire service <a href="https://graphql.org/"><b>GraphQL</b></a> API using data models defined via GraphQL files. Using GraphQL for data modeling also empowered other (more front-end oriented) developers to submit schema modifications with minimal additional assistance.</li>
      <li>Helped develop and maintain LocalGraf's administrative interface and AWS infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Assisted in building <b>React</b> components, mostly centered around functionality that utilized LocalGraf.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Performed <b>ETL</b> and data quality work for multiple feature projects utilizing LocalGraf such as the <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/sponsored/giving-guide/">North Texas Giving Guide</a>, annual <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/top-100/">Top 100 Workplaces</a>, and <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/school-guide/">School Guide</a></li>
  <li>Assisted in migrating <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/">dallasnews.com</a> from a custom CMS to the Washington Post's (React-based) Arc Fusion platform (now <a href="https://www.arcxp.com/">Arc XP</a>) for a site relaunch.</li>
</ul>
