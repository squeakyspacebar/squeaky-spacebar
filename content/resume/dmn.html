<p>At the <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/">Dallas Morning News</a>, I primarily worked on building LocalGraf, a graph-based knowledge system backed by AWS Neptune and GraphQL intended to power features across the DMN website. I designed and wrote much of the fundamental software for LocalGraf.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Built core software (in Node) for an internal knowledge graph system (called LocalGraf) utilizing Amazon Neptune and Elasticsearch.</li>
  <li>Wrote a preprocessor (called Pegasis) that dynamically generated the entire LocalGraf GraphQL API, creating the GraphQL query/mutation endpoint definitions, their handler functions, and standing up the API server, using GraphQL as a DDL (data definition language). Using Pegasis in combination with GraphQL files for defining the data model allowed less back-end-oriented developers to submit schema modifications for review via PR with minimal additional training.</li>
  <li>Wrote a basic OGM (object-graph mapping) library (called Mogwai) that generated Gremlin queries and facilitated communication between Amazon Neptune and JavaScript applications (i.e. Pegasis).</li>
  <li>Helped develop and maintain LocalGraf's supporting systems such as the administrative interface and AWS infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Managed implementation, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), and data quality for a number of content features that utilized LocalGraf including the <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/sponsored/giving-guide/">North Texas Giving Guide</a>, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/top-100/">Top 100 Places to Work</a>, and <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/school-guide/">School Guide</a>.</li>
  <li>Assisted in migrating the main website from a custom CMS to WaPo's (React-based) Arc Fusion platform as part of the dallasnews.com relaunch.</li>
  <li>Assisted in developing React components for the DMN website, often centered around <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/things-to-do/">Things to Do</a> event search functionality since it tied heavily into LocalGraf.</li>
</ul>
