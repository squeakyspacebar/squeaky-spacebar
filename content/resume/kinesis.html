<p>I created an asset for the <a href="https://unity.com/"><b>Unity</b></a> Asset Store that provided a simulated muscle model.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researched <b>biomechanics</b> to implement a <b>Hill-type muscle model</b> in Unity for controlling physical character movements through muscle activation.</li>
  <li>Carefully studied muscle anatomy and motion to rig a humanoid model with 200+ individual modeled muscles based on real human skeletal muscles.</li>
  <li>Built several Unity editor components to aid in-editor muscle creation and testing.</li>
  <li>Utilized <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html"><b>Doxygen</b></a> to generate well-formatted comprehensive user and API documentation in HTML and PDF formats.</li>
  <li>Experimented with <b>reinforcement learning</b> and <b>CMA-ES</b> strategies to build a controller for humanoid locomotion.</li>
</ul>
