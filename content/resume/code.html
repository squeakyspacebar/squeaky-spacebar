<p>I joined the <a href="https://www.opendataenterprise.org/">Center for Open Data Enterprise</a> to work on the <a href="https://www.sdgreporting.org/">UN SDG National Reporting Initiative project</a>, which aimed at helping national organizations share information on implementing platforms for reporting on <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>. After the initial UN SDG National Reporting Initiative project effort ended, I continued to assist with some additional project work and volunteered maintenance time.</p>

      <li>Implemented and deployed the website utilizing a Jamstack solution (Jekyll, Vue, Netlify, and PostgreSQL-backed Express APIs utilizing Sequelize) with additional services such as Forest Admin to better leverage limited financial and technical resources.</li>
      <li>Created a filtered keyword search of resources powered using only PostgreSQL in order to minimize resource usage and maintenance complexity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Overhauled CODE's <a href="https://www.opendataimpactmap.org/">Open Data Impact Map</a> website (JavaScript and PHP), including relational schema redesign, bugfixing, code refactoring (eliminated ~20k lines of code), and infrastructure updates.</li>
