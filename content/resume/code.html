<p>I joined the <a href="https://www.opendataenterprise.org/">Center for Open Data Enterprise</a> as a sole developer to work on the <a href="https://www.sdgreporting.org/">UN SDG National Reporting Initiative</a> project, a platform aimed at helping national organizations share knowledge on implementing reporting for the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>. After the initial UN SDG National Reporting Initiative project stage ended, I continued to assist with additional projects and volunteered maintenance time.</p>
