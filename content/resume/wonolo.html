<p>Inaugural member of a newly formed Build and Release Tools (i.e. Build/Release Engineering) along with the team lead. The team’s purview was maintaining and improving software build and release practices, involving an equal mix of navigating both human (interpersonal/cross-team) and technological challenges toward solutions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed and implemented a tool in Ruby (called Arborist) to assist with a department-wide code ownership initiative. Arborist generated code ownership trees (for a given repository) from multiple sources of truth, reconciled them into a single tree, and generated a canonical CODEOWNERS file (GitHub), which served as a mapping of a repository’s files to the GitHub team(s) that owned them.</li>
  <li>Implemented a service in Node.js that generated recommendations for pull request reviewers based on data from the repository’s CODEOWNERS file and other custom criteria. The service integrated with configured GitHub repositories and published recommendation reports as comments within open pull requests.</li>
  <li>Helped maintain and improve an internal queue service (with Slack bot interface) in Python that integrated with GitHub and our CI/CD platform to allow developers to collaboratively manage sharing of exclusive deployment resources and support developers in monitoring their builds/deployments.</li>
  <li>Wrote a lot of unit and integration tests for all of the above.</li>
  <li>Responsible (as a team member) for stewardship of our CI/CD solution and assisting other teams in utilizing it successfully.</li>
  <li>Drove and participated in a lot of inter-team discussions about process improvements, best practices, and how our team could help improve developer experience.</li>
</ul>
