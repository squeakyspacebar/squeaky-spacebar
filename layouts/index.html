  <h2>Professional</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Andy Lo. Squeaky Spacebar is my handle. Mostly a full-stack developer by trade, I've striven to focus on conscientious opportunities throughout my professional career. I care about discipline, process, and doing things The Right Way™, but am overall mission driven, results oriented, and anti-dogmatic.</p>
  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <p>Here are all the labels from the serious to the silly. American born and raised in Texas, Taiwanese-Chinese through ancestry and heritage. Existentialist, empiricist, centre-left, INT(J/P), Aquarius, Fire Rabbit (火兔), Ravenclaw. Moderately-traveled foodie. I enjoy things that are simultaneously experimental and grounded.</p>
