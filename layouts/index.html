  <h2>Professional</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Andy Lo. Squeaky Spacebar is my handle. Mostly a full-stack developer by trade, I've striven to focus on conscientious opportunities throughout my professional career. I care about discipline, process, and doing things The Right Way™, but am overall mission driven, results oriented, and anti-dogmatic.</p>
  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <p>All the labels, from serious to silly: American born and raised in Texas, Taiwanese-Chinese through ancestry and heritage, existentialist, empiricist, centre-left, INT(J/P), Aquarius, Fire Rabbit (火兔), Ravenclaw, moderately-traveled foodie, cinema aficionado. I enjoy the simultaneously experimental yet grounded.</p>
